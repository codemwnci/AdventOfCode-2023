# Advent of Code - 2023 - Using Kotlin

Here are my attempts at the Advent of Code 2023 challenges, all using Kotlin.

Each day's answers can be found in the `src/main/kotlin/` directory, with one Kotlin File/Class per day.

I have attempted to use the power of idiomatic Kotlin where possible, but I am sure many of these puzzles can be solved in more elegant and idiomatic ways. I have also tried to favour functional and immutability where possible.
